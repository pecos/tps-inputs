Remember to

1) Create soft link to your tps executable (i.e., ./tps must be set)
2) Update FS_MOUNT and CONTAINER_DIR in slurn.N.job for your environment
3) Adjust the number_of_nodes variable that lists the node counts you want to run

Then, run the bash script

./quartz-submit.sh,

which will simultaneously submit all the jobs for all node counts, but
with each one depending on the previous (i.e., if you ask for
number_of_nodes=("1" "2" "4"), then the 1 node job has no dependency,
the 2 node job depends on the 1 node job, and the 4 node job depends
on the 2 node job).
