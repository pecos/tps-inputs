This case corresponds to an axisymmetric argon plasma torch with 2.5
kW input plasma power.  It uses a single, reversible ionization
reaction.  The case was restarted from an LTE simulation (using the
`restartFromLTE = True` option) and then run for 5000 steps at cfl =
0.025, in order to march through a fast initial transient when the
reactions are turned on.  After that, the cfl was set to 0.1 and it
was run another 5000 steps to generate the restart file included here.
