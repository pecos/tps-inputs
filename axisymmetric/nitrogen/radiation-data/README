This directory contains hdf5 files with NEC data for use in TPS and
the inputs used to generate those files.

The h5 files where constructed in the following manner.  For T > 4500,
data were extracted (using WebPlotDigitizer,
https://apps.automeris.io/wpd/) from Figure 17 in

This image is stored here as nitrogen_nec.png, and the data extracted
are stored in the csv files in this directory.  Because the plot does
not show results for T < 4500, the data in this region are
extrapolated using a power law relationship constructed to match the
lowest temperature behavior.  See the write_nec.py script, which
performs the extrapolation and writes the full resulting NEC model to
h5 files for use in TPS.

This low temperature region should not matter much, since the nec is
very low relative to that at higher temperatures, so it does not play
much of a role in the power balance.  However, we should probably
construct our own NEC model to avoid this ad hoc extrapolation.
