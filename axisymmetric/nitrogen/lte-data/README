These LTE tables are generated using Plato
(git@github.com:chess-uiuc/plato.git) with the 'nitrogen5' mixture (e
N N2 N2p Np).  The 2-D tables are direct outputs of the lte app within
Plato.  The 1-D tables are generated by the extractOneAtmData.py
script, which extracts just atmospheric pressure results from the 2-D
tables.
